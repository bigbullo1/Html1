        <h2> BATMAN'S MISSION</h2>
        <p> The nigga batman you know is on a mission . A mission of constant self improvement. Where he seeks redemption for the unjust he has done to himself by not being his best version. While this mission be may ignore you  cuz he's on a strict daily routine where he has absolutely not kept a single second for himself . He eats , prays, works, learns, sleeps  and repeats. Even in this hard schedule if he talks to you, you mean something .
                
                Keep supporting the Nigga bats just like you have been. Its his promise he gonna become the wildest, strongest, badass creature youve ever seen.
